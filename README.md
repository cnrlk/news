# Bundle - Android Engineer Assessment
Hey, thanks for taking the time to try out this test! ðŸ‘‹

The goal of this test is to assert (to some degree) your technical, architectural, and problem-solving skills. You're given a simple problem so you can focus on showing off your technique.

We're hoping to hear back from you in 2 days, but if you need more time then no problem as long as you let us know.

# Problem Statement
This is a simple news app that allows users to view a list of news and read the details of each one in either web or reader mode. 
You should use JSON files to fetch the list and details of the news.

** News List Page ** 

Displays a list of news sorted by "pubDate" in descending order, with the newest one at the top. 

- Fetch news from the "news.json" file and cached to avoid reloading the file each time the app is opened.
- There should be a button or switch to sort the news list by "pubDate" in ascending or descending order. 
- App should remember the user's last selection for sorting and display the news list accordingly when reopened.

** News Detail Page **

Displays the details of a news item when the user taps on it in the list screen. 

- The news detail information should be read from the news-detail.json file.
- There should be two modes on the page, "Web and Reader". 
- News detail should open in Web mode by default. Users should be able to switch between these modes.

Web mode: The news detail should be displayed in a WebView using the "link" parameter under news-detail.json.
Reader mode: The news detail should be displayed using the "title", "description", and "imageUrl" parameters under news-detail.json.

# Requirements

# Rules
- You must not commit to the master branch of this repository.
- Create a pull request with your solution. The pull request body should contain instructions for testing your solution, talk about any improvements you would make in a production setup, and justify some of your decisions.
- As this is a code review process, you must not add generated code to the project.
- You should reply to any questions asked in comments on the pull request.

# Evaluation Criteria
To give you an idea of what we are looking for in a successful solution:

- Efficient problem-solving skills. You know when complexity is required, and when to keep things simple.
- Easy for us to run the solution locally, with detailed instructions and/or a setup script.
- The solution is logically organised. Your code is documented, well-formatted, and easy to follow.
- Your PR description is clear and informative. You will be assessed on communication skills as well as technical prowess.
- A tidy Git commit history (even if it's brief).
